# PDFViewer
Web-based front-end for organizing, listing and displaying PDF documents.

PDFViewer is a web-based tool designed to easily organize and present different PDF files, all in one interface. No back-end code is necessary.

The PDFViewer interface consists of an "index" or a sidebar with a list of documents. When a user clicks on an index entry, the PDF document appears on the right-hand side of the users screen. The interface also supports normal hyperlinks, a helpful feature if a document is maintained in multiple file types.
